## Data Structure

### Employee Records
```javascript
{
  name: 'Last, First',
  type: 'FT' | 'PT',
  department: 'Operations',
  position: 'Full Time',
  empId: 'EMP001',
  hire_date: '2023-01-01',
  shifts: '7a-3p',
  availability: 'Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri',
  max_days: 5,
  target_hours: 160
}
```

### PTO Request Records
```javascript
{
  employeeId: 'firebase-doc-id',
  reason: 'Vacation',
  startDate: Timestamp,
  endDate: Timestamp,
  submittedAt: Timestamp,
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied'
}
```

## PTO Balance Calculation

The system automatically calculates PTO balances based on:
- **Full-time employees**: 20 days per year
- **Part-time employees**: 10 days per year
- **Used PTO**: Sum of approved request days
- **Pending PTO**: Sum of pending request days
- **Available PTO**: Total - Used - Pending

## Mobile Responsiveness

The application is fully responsive with:
- Collapsible sidebar for mobile navigation
- Responsive tables with horizontal scrolling
- Touch-optimized buttons and forms
- Adaptive grid layouts
- Mobile-first CSS approach

## Security & Access Control

Current implementation uses Firebase anonymous authentication. For production:

1. **Implement proper user authentication**
2. **Add role-based access control**:
   - Employees: Submit and edit own requests
   - Managers: Approve/deny requests
   - Admins: Full system access
3. **Secure Firestore rules** based on user roles
